[x] Connect timer
[x] s/frame_send/send (only one type of send)
[x] s/xq/nq (nano queue) (nope, nitro)
[x] Decide on bind (okay after start)
[x] Actual build system
[x] Break up into multiple files
[x] Clean up API (remove frame etc prefixing... small project?)
[x] Remove socket types
[x] Inproc
[i] Pub/Sub
	[x] Inproc
	[X] TCP
    [ ] Unsub
    [x] TCP Async re-broadcast on change
    [x] TCP re-broadcast on timer
[x] Close async request
[x] Way to shut down everything?
[ ] Sessions (frame query and reply api)
    [ ] manual flush so app can control
[ ] Keep-alive and timeouts
    [ ] Use TCP keepalive?
[ ] Select-style multi-wait api
[ ] More options (set capacity, max packet
    size, linger, etc)
[ ] More inspection (connectedness state,
    queue lengths)
[ ] Tests
     [x] Framework
[ ] Object pools (frames?  keys?  pipes?)
[x] Write CAS pool
[i] Memory checks
[ ] Benchmarks
[ ] Docs
[ ] Push
[ ] Questions -- shorten api more (no "frame" and "socket")?


-- Future ideas --
[ ] Engine Groups (abstract away multicore, share a socket)
     [ ] Are sockets really fully thread-safe?
