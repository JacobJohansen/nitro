[x] Nonblock send/recv -- change all internal uses to use this
[x] Socket Options
[x] STCP
[x] Async help... eventfd etc
[x] Shutdown clean
[x] Leak check
[x] Error handling in various places we return -1, use err.c for nice messages
[x] Security/robustness on TCP upstream.
    .. aka Close on error instead of assert()
[x] Inproc
[x] Change REUSE/NOCOPY -- refcount frames, isolate parts that are "non final",
    like in-progress iovecs, pub keys?  speed difference...
[x] Re-align socket fields
[x] Torture
    - leak-free torture
[x] error thread safety
[ ] Ramp up TCP come-alive on write.  Timer + cancel idea.
[ ] Resolve names
[ ] Inproc, send/fw on queue full, skip?  go around once?
[ ] Inproc queuing.. use send queue on
    bound sock?
[ ] Safety of async jobs with TCP?
[ ] XXX HWM BUG
[ ] Socket Diagnostics (HUP report, stats, query queue sizes, etc)
[i] Python bindings
[i] Haskell bindings
[ ] Leak check
[ ] Kill all XXX
[ ] Re-run style
[ ] Verify file headers are present and correct in src/*.{c,h}
[ ] Namespace all _H #defines in headers (add NITRO_)
[ ] Verify non-exports are static
[ ] Static Analysis (splint? coverity free?)
[ ] More tests
    - hwm
    - secure verify
    - eventfd
[ ] Turn this TODO into github issues!  :-)
