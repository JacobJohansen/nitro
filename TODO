[x] Connect timer
[x] s/frame_send/send (only one type of send)
[x] s/xq/nq (nano queue) (nope, nitro)
[x] Decide on bind (okay after start)
[x] Actual build system
[x] Break up into multiple files
[x] Clean up API (remove frame etc prefixing... small project?)
[x] Remove socket types
[x] Inproc
[ ] Pub/Sub
	[x] Inproc
	[X] TCP
    [ ] Unsub?
    [ ] TCP Async re-broadcast on change
    [ ] TCP re-broadcast on timer
[x] Close async request
[x] Way to shut down everything?
[ ] Sessions (frame query and reply api)
    [ ] manual flush so app can control
[ ] Keep-alive and timeouts
    [ ] How to jam keep-alives in there when
        the outgoing buffer is full
    [ ] Echo packet... or use tcp keepalive
[ ] Select-style multi-wait api
[ ] More options (set capacity, max packet
    size, linger, etc)
[ ] More inspection (connectedness state,
    queue lengths)
[ ] Tests
[ ] Benchmarks
[ ] Memory checks
[ ] Docs
[ ] Push
[ ] Questions -- shorten api more (no "frame" and "socket")?

-- Future ideas --
[ ] Engine Groups (abstract away multicore, share a socket)
